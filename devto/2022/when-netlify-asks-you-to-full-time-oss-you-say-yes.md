Well, there it is.

I'm ecstatic to announce that, as of today, I’ve joined OSS Team at Netlify as a principal engineer.

Yes that's right - Netlify has enabled me to be 100% dedicated to open source software. With their backing, I can focus on upstream open source, contributing to important projects that have a real impact in the direction of the web.

## Solid Foundations

First, to answer the obvious question - I'm finally able to work on [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) as my day job. I couldn't be more excited.

Netlify was one of the first companies to recognize Solid's potential, making financial contributions since last year. It’s fair to say that, by hiring me, they plan to continue supporting this work.

This means great things for the project. SolidJS has shown itself to have [high satisfaction](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks) and unmatched performance (both [in browser](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2022/table_chrome_99.0.4844.51.html) and [on server](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-we-wrote-the-fastest-javascript-ui-framework-again-db097ddd99b6)). Now it’s time to focus on getting it into people’s hands.

What does this mean?

- [SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start), Solid's SSR framework, will get much more focus
- Improving the development and deployment stories for all SolidJS projects
- Preparing for the future and SolidJS 2.0

Most importantly though, Netlify has given me the bandwidth to *explore*. After over a year of ideating, researching and writing, I can finally start building.

As amazing as this all is, it gets even better.

## The Future of Jamstack

Netlify and [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) are practically synonymous. Netlify came on the scene championing this approach, aggressively simplifying the way we could build and deploy web applications. And by any measure this was incredibly successful. So much so that Jamstack has grown to encompass much more than its JavaScript, APIs, and Markup acronym would suggest.

To me it’s clear that the growth in the space isn’t limited to the Jamstack, it’s pushed the technologies forward as well. The Edge is the new CDN. Dynamic is the new static. This means new approaches and new exploration. I've been pushing the boundaries from the outside - now I'm putting myself right in the middle.

## The Future of OSS

I’m lucky to have found a company so dedicated to improving the quality of the web for all, especially one that does so in the open. No proprietary frameworks, no proprietary platforms. Just a company that mirrors my own drive to help the best solutions rise to the top, regardless of where they come from. They’ve given me the latitude to see that through.

My work’s focus on open source means I get to continue collaborating closely with other projects shaping this new world. Projects like [Marko](https://www.markojs.com/), [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Deno](https://deno.land/) and so many more, pushing the limits of [hydration](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/conquering-javascript-hydration-a9f), [compilation](https://dev.to/ryansolid/marko-compiling-fine-grained-reactivity-4lk4), [reactivity](https://indepth.dev/posts/1289/solidjs-reactivity-to-rendering), and [routing](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-return-of-server-side-routing-b05), and working with these teams to make these futures a reality.

I talk a lot about doing research and pushing boundaries. But perhaps the greatest thing about taking on a role like this is to positively impact the ecosystem of where developers are today. To help bring those benefits to existing frameworks and tools. That's what open source is all about.

It is an incredible time to be working in open source web development. I can't wait to see what we will build. Together.
