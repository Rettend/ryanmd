I’ve recently read a few articles making some pretty outrageous claims, based on little more than anecdotal references to a few conference talks. Part of it is the time of year. As we move from one year to the next it is a good time to look forward to the future. And I don’t even think all the sentiment is misplaced, just that the evidence and justifications are lacking. We might get there one day but that day is not today.

So let’s dig into a few ones that have been floating around the past year.

## Myth #1: Web Components replace Frameworks/Libraries

Web Components are a series of technologies to enable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be modularized in a reusable way just using HTML Elements. These technologies add features to the DOM that were previously missing to aid in this goal including templating, CSS encapsulation, element lifecycle hooks including attribute watching, and child element slotting. On the surface, these are many of the same features implemented by UI Frameworks and ultimately you end up with Components. So they must be equivalent right?
